 * Addr:housenumbers
 * Main POIs for typical metro residents: shops=* and amenity=* (withouth car features)
 * More attention for pedestrians: Highways for cars marked by only one color, footways are more remarkable.

## Installation

This folder is a tilemill project. Just put it to ~/Documents/tilemill/projects/

### More detailed installation

Install a TileMill 0.10.2-dev, or build it from source. See the https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/ for info.

Clone this map style

   cd ~/Documents/MapBox/project
   git clone https://github.com/nextgis/metro4all_cartostyle.git

####  Download shapefiles

OSM Bright depends on two large shapefiles. You will need to download and extract them before continuing. 

Download them to the `shp` directory in the osm-bright folder. You can do this with `wget` like:

    wget http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/simplified-land-polygons-complete-3857.zip
    wget http://data.openstreetmapdata.com/land-polygons-split-3857.zip

Once downloaded, extract them from their zip files. 

#### Run the shapefiles through shapeindex

Shapeindex is a tool that improves performance for shapefiles in Tilemill. 

Mac and Linux users already have Shapeindex installed through Tilemill but Windows users will need to download [Shapeindex for Windows][] before continuing. 

To run Shapeindex on Mac and Linux, go to the terminal, move to the shp directory of osm-bright, run shapeindex in each shp subdirectory like: 

shapeindex land-polygons-split-3857.shp

[Shapeindex for Windows]: http://mapnik.s3.amazonaws.com/dist/archive/shapeindex-2.2.0-win-x86_32.zip
